* About
This is a custom archlinux live-usb mainly meant for setting up encrypted
installations. This uses [[swaywm.org/][sway]] and [[https://github.com/thestinger/termite][termite]], for maximum cross compatibility.

** Methodology
Instead of using the standard ~archiso~ package, since I required AUR packages
and preferred an offline installation, this uses [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Archiso_offline][archiso-offline]].

** Software Included
The exact list of packages added is present in ~packages.x86_64~
The basic end-user packages and the intended usage is described here.
** Size
Just cuz I can, this lists the size as I make changes:

| Package         | Size (MB) |
| base            |     ~ 567 |
| +veracrypt      |       688 |
| +networkmanager |       695 |
** Configuration
*** Pacman
The pacman mirrors are generated with ~reflector~.
